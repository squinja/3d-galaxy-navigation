In-progress 3-D Spiral Galaxy featuring pages of my portfolio and fun user interactivity, such as being able to spin the galaxy!

NOTE.

- Please view the page on a screen that is wider than 750px.

Known Issues: The page-travel buttons are still a bit glitchy, please bear with me.


Some features I'm planning on adding soon:
- Loaded 3-D models of 'space stations' for the colorful 'points of interest'.
- Star-like graphics for the currently white, square points representing stars.
- Some fun features when you spin the galaxy.
- Smoothing the spin of the galaxy.
- Much later: A full-on animation built in 3.js representing a space ship flying to the 'space station'. Like this (https://youtu.be/gltOzrSed1A?t=66).
