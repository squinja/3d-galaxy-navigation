In-progress 3-D Spiral Galaxy featuring pages of my portfolio and fun user interactivity, such as being able to spin the galaxy!

NOTE.

- Please view the page on a screen that is wider than 750px.

Known Issues: When two space stations/points of interest generate over eachother (not often), raycasting goes through both. This causes the identified class objects to be 'doubled up' so that two buttons appear on the left UI. 


Some features I'm planning on adding soon:
- Loaded 3-D models of 'space stations' for the colorful 'points of interest'.
- Star-like graphics for the currently white, square points representing stars.
- Some fun features when you spin the galaxy.
- Smoothing the spin of the galaxy.
- Much later: A full-on animation built in 3.js representing a space ship flying to the 'space station'. Like this (https://youtu.be/gltOzrSed1A?t=66).
